# AccountMerge

This is a coding challenge I did in TS. The instructions for the challenge are listed in the Instructions.txt file. 

Before running project, make sure you ```yarn install```

To run the accounts.ts file alone, use the command ```npx ts-node accounts.ts``` from your terminal.

I've created some tests for this project which are located in the accounts.spec.ts file, and you can run these tests with the command ```yarn test```
